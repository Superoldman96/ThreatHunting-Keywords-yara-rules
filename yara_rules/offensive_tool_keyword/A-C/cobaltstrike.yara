Both the process and shellcode are specified by the user. The primary use case is as a JavaScript/VBScript loader via DotNetToJScript. which can be utilised in a variety of payload types such as HTA and VBA.

Both the process and shellcode are specified by the user. The primary use case is as a JavaScript/VBScript loader via DotNetToJScript. which can be utilised in a variety of payload types such as HTA and VBA.
